# Base Image: We're using openjdk:17-jdk-slim because it's lightweight and includes Java 17, which is suitable for modern Spring Boot applications.






# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the jar file into the container at /app
COPY target/your-spring-boot-app.jar /app/app.jar

# Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the jar file 
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","/app/app.jar"]

# Use a non-root user for better security
RUN addgroup --system spring && adduser --system --ingroup spring spring
USER spring:spring

# Optionally, you might want to set some environment variables for your Spring Boot application:
ENV SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
ENV JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx512m -Xms256m"
